# Repo health and validation

Use this checklist before publishing or packaging `ai-pm-toolkit`.

## Structural checks

```bash
bash scripts/check_requirements.sh
python3 -m py_compile scripts/*.py
bash -n hooks/*.sh
python3 scripts/sync_skills.py --check
python3 scripts/validate_repo.py
python3 scripts/test_hooks.py
python3 scripts/test_memory.py
```

`validate_repo.py` covers:

- `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter for the root skill and every skill under the canonical `skills/` tree.
- Local markdown links and backtick-quoted file paths (canonical + repo docs; the `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` mirrors are byte copies, checked separately by drift).
- `skills/WORKFLOW.md` parsing into the canonical eight-stage contract.
- `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` hook shape, unsupported matchers, timeout units, and that every referenced command target exists.
- Hook shell syntax, and that shared `hooks/*.sh` scripts carry no harness-specific paths (`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.agents/`) — enforcement logic must work under both harnesses identically.
- Mirror drift: `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` match `skills/` exactly (`scripts/sync_skills.py --check`).
- Memory bootstrap compatibility between `init_context.py`, `memory.py doctor`, and `stage_context.py`.

`scripts/test_hooks.py` runs synthetic payloads against the shared gates and the Codex `apply_patch` adapter to confirm both harness paths block and unblock correctly.

`scripts/test_memory.py` runs `memory.py` and `init_context.py` in a throwaway repo skeleton: caps, the `distill --prepare/--apply` fold (verbatim archive, stale and oversized packages refused, undated blocks never folded), and the in-code PII denylist.

## Bootstrap smoke test

```bash
python3 scripts/init_context.py "Validation Demo"
python3 scripts/memory.py doctor
python3 scripts/stage_context.py
```

Expected result: `memory.py doctor` passes and `stage_context.py` emits a stage block with Inputs / Process / Output-gate.

## Hook portability

The content-sentinel hooks support both Linux and macOS hashing:

- Linux: `sha256sum`
- macOS: `shasum -a 256`

If neither exists, the hooks fail closed with an actionable error.
