# Humanizer patterns 14–35: style, chatbot, filler and hedging
Upstream content: blader/humanizer `SKILL.md` lines 179–391 at commit e2e92e7 (2.11.2), verbatim. Lines starting with `Toolkit note:` are this repo's overlay; everything else is upstream.

## Style patterns

### 14. Em and en dashes

**Rule:** The final rewrite must not contain em dashes (—) or en dashes (–), unless the writer's sample uses them. Replace a dash with a period, comma, colon, or parentheses, or rewrite the sentence. Also check for spaced dashes (` — `) and double hyphens (` -- `) used as dashes.
**Before:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions—not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address—yet this mislabeling continues—even in official documents.
**After:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address, yet this mislabeling continues in official documents.
**Before:**
> The new policy — announced without warning — affects thousands of workers. The changes -- long overdue according to critics -- will take effect immediately.
**After:**
> The new policy, announced without warning, affects thousands of workers. The changes, long overdue according to critics, will take effect immediately.

Before returning the rewrite, search for `—` and `–`. Remove each one unless the writer's sample uses that mark. In that case, match the sample's rate.

Toolkit note: the reply-time Stop hook (scope-bloat-gate.sh) blocks em-dash density in chat replies only; in documents this pattern is the rule, applied by hand.

### 15. Too much bold text
**Problem:** AI chatbots often bold words and phrases without a clear reason.
**Before:**
> It blends **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**, **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**, and visual strategy tools such as the **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** and **Balanced Scorecard (BSC)**.
**After:**
> It blends OKRs, KPIs, and visual strategy tools like the Business Model Canvas and Balanced Scorecard.

### 16. Lists with bold mini-headings
**Problem:** AI writing often uses vertical lists in which every item starts with a bold label and a colon.
**Before:**
> - **User Experience:** The user experience has been significantly improved with a new interface.
> - **Performance:** Performance has been enhanced through optimized algorithms.
> - **Security:** Security has been strengthened with end-to-end encryption.
**After:**
> The update improves the interface, speeds up load times through optimized algorithms, and adds end-to-end encryption.

Toolkit note: the structural twin (label-colon bullets in docs and replies) is anti-slop B3; apply this pattern when the list sits inside prose.

### 17. Title case in headings
**Problem:** AI chatbots often capitalize every main word in a heading.
**Before:**
> ## Strategic Negotiations And Global Partnerships
**After:**
> ## Strategic negotiations and global partnerships

### 18. Emojis
**Problem:** AI chatbots often add emojis to headings and list items as decoration.
**Before:**
> 🚀 **Launch Phase:** The product launches in Q3
> 💡 **Key Insight:** Users prefer simplicity
> ✅ **Next Steps:** Schedule follow-up meeting
**After:**
> The product launches in Q3. User research showed a preference for simplicity. Next step: schedule a follow-up meeting.

Toolkit note: a decorative emoji at the start of a new markdown heading is hard-blocked on write by anti-slop-gate.sh (anti-slop B6); this pattern covers emoji inside prose and list items.

### 19. Curly quotation marks
**Problem:** ChatGPT often uses curly quotes (“...”) where the writer or target format uses straight quotes ("...").
**Before:**
> He said “the project is on track” but others disagreed.
**After:**
> He said "the project is on track" but others disagreed.

## Chatbot patterns

### 20. Chatbot text left in the answer

**Words to watch:** I hope this helps, Of course!, Certainly!, You're absolutely right!, Would you like..., Want me to...?, Want me to give examples?, Should I continue?, let me know, here is a...
**Problem:** A chatbot's greeting, offer, or closing sometimes remains in text that should stand on its own.
**Before:**
> Here is an overview of the French Revolution. I hope this helps! Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any section.
**After:**
> The French Revolution began in 1789 when financial crisis and food shortages led to widespread unrest.

### 21. Knowledge-limit disclaimers and guesses

**Words to watch:** as of [date], Up to my last training update, While specific details are limited/scarce..., based on available information, not publicly available, maintains a low profile, keeps personal details private, prefers to stay out of the spotlight, likely [grew up/studied/began], it is believed that
**Problem:** Older models may mention the date when their knowledge ends. A model may also explain that it could not find a source, then fill the gap with a plausible guess. State what the source does not show, or remove the sentence. Do not present a guess as a fact.
**Before (cutoff disclaimer):**
> While specific details about the company's founding are not extensively documented in readily available sources, it appears to have been established sometime in the 1990s.
**After:**
> The company's founding date is not documented in the available sources. (Or cut the sentence. State a date only if a source provides one.)
**Before (speculative gap-fill):**
> Information about her early life is not publicly available, suggesting she maintains a low profile and keeps personal details private. She likely grew up in a middle-class household, which shaped her later interest in education reform.
**After:**
> Her early life is not documented in the available sources. (Or omit the section.)

### 22. Overly agreeable tone
**Problem:** AI assistants often praise the user or agree before giving the answer.
**Before:**
> Great question! You're absolutely right that this is a complex topic. That's an excellent point about the economic factors.
**After:**
> The economic factors you mentioned are relevant here.

Toolkit note: sycophantic openers in chat replies are anti-slop C3; this pattern covers them inside prose artefacts.

## Filler and hedging

### 23. Filler phrases

**Before → After:**
- "In order to achieve this goal" → "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that it was raining" → "Because it was raining"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "In the event that you need help" → "If you need help"
- "The system has the ability to process" → "The system can process"
- "It is important to note that the data shows" → "The data shows"

### 24. Too many qualifiers

**Phrases to watch:** to be fair, it's also possible, could potentially, might arguably, in some cases it may, this is an inference
**Problem:** Repeated editing can add one qualifier after another until every claim sounds uncertain. Keep a qualifier only when the source supports it and the meaning needs it. Remove caveats that only repair an earlier overstatement.
**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.
**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.

### 25. Generic positive endings
**Problem:** AI writing often ends with vague optimism instead of the last useful fact.
**Before:**
> The future looks bright for the company. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence. This represents a major step in the right direction.
**After:**
> (Cut the paragraph. End on the last concrete fact instead of a send-off. If the source states real plans, use those.)

### 26. Too many hyphenated word pairs

**Words to watch:** third-party, cross-functional, client-facing, data-driven, decision-making, well-known, high-quality, real-time, long-term, end-to-end
**Problem:** AI writing often hyphenates these pairs everywhere. Keep the hyphen before a noun when grammar needs it, as in `a high-quality report`. Drop it after the noun, as in `the report is high quality`.
**Before:**
> The cross-functional team delivered a high-quality, data-driven report. The team is cross-functional, the report is high-quality, and the methodology is data-driven.
**After:**
> The cross-functional team delivered a high-quality, data-driven report. The team is cross functional, the report is high quality, and the methodology is data driven.

### 27. Pretending to reveal a deeper truth

**Phrases to watch:** The real question is, at its core, in reality, what really matters, fundamentally, the deeper issue, the heart of the matter
**Problem:** AI writing uses these phrases to make an ordinary point sound like a hidden truth.
**Before:**
> The real question is whether teams can adapt. At its core, what really matters is organizational readiness.
**After:**
> The question is whether teams can adapt. That mostly depends on whether the organization is ready to change its habits.

### 28. Announcing the next point

**Phrases to watch:** Let's dive in, let's explore, let's break this down, here's what you need to know, now let's look at, without further ado, heads up, quick note, before I forget
**Problem:** AI writing often announces the next point instead of stating it. A casual phrase such as "one thing that bit me" can have the same problem. Remove the announcement, not just its formal tone.
**Before:**
> Let's dive into how caching works in Next.js. Here's what you need to know.
**After:**
> Next.js caches data at multiple layers, including request memoization, the data cache, and the router cache.
**Before (casual register):**
> One thing that bit me hard, so pay attention to this part: the webpack dev server doesn't send the CORS header by default.
**After:**
> The webpack dev server doesn't send the CORS header by default.

### 29. A heading repeated in the first sentence

**Signs to watch:** A heading followed by a one-line paragraph that simply restates the heading before the real content begins.
**Problem:** AI writing often follows a heading with a sentence that only repeats the heading. Remove the repeated sentence.
**Before:**
> ## Performance
>
> Speed matters.
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.
**After:**
> ## Performance
>
> When users hit a slow page, they leave.

### 30. Writing about the previous version
**Problem:** Documentation and comments should describe the current behavior. Mention the previous version only in change logs, release notes, migration guides, and other documents about change.
**Before:**
> This function was added to replace the previous approach of iterating through all items, which caused O(n²) performance.
**After:**
> This function uses a hash map for O(1) lookups, avoiding the O(n²) cost of naive iteration.

### 31. Forced punchlines and dramatic fragments
**Problem:** AI writing often turns each sentence into a dramatic closing line. One short sentence can add emphasis. A row of short fragments usually feels forced.
**Before:**
> Then AlphaEvolve arrived. It had no preference for symmetry. No aesthetic prior. No nostalgia for human taste. The old rules were gone.
**After:**
> AlphaEvolve changed the search because it did not favor symmetry or human-looking designs. That made some of the older assumptions less useful.

### 32. Formulaic sayings

**Words to watch:** X is the Y of Z, X becomes a trap, X is not a tool but a mirror, the language of, the currency of, the architecture of
**Problem:** AI writing often turns an ordinary claim into a saying that sounds deep but adds no detail. Replace the saying with the specific claim.
**Before:**
> Symmetry is the language of trust. Efficiency becomes a trap when teams forget the human layer.
**After:**
> Symmetric layouts often feel more predictable to users. Teams can over-optimize workflows and miss how people actually use them.

### 33. Fake-candid openings

**Phrases to watch:** Honestly?, Look, Here's the thing, The thing is, Let's be honest, Real talk, when used as standalone hooks or fake-candid pauses before an ordinary point.
**Problem:** AI writing often starts with a staged pause or claim of honesty before making a routine point. State the point directly.
**Before:**
> Is it worth the price? Honestly? It depends on how often you'll use it.
**After:**
> Whether it's worth the price depends on how often you'll use it.

### 34. Answering objections no one raised

**Phrases to watch:** This isn't (mainly/really) about, I'm not saying/arguing/trying to, To be clear, Don't get me wrong, This is not to say, You could argue/frame this differently but, Some might say... but
**Problem:** AI writing may answer an objection that does not appear in the text. Watch for an unattributed statement about what the writer does not mean, especially when the topic appears nowhere else. A direct claim such as "the API is not thread-safe" is not this pattern.
**Before:**
> This isn't mainly about prompt length, and I'm not arguing that documentation doesn't matter. You could categorize the problem another way, but the issue is whether the agent can use the instruction when it acts.
**After:**
> The issue is whether the agent can use the instruction when it acts.

Remove only the unsupported defense. If it contains a real claim, state that claim directly. Keep an objection when the text names its source or answers it in full.

### 35. Rejecting fake alternatives

**Phrases to watch:** A tempting option/approach would be, One might be tempted to, An obvious approach would be, You might think... but, It would be easy to just, Some would suggest
**Problem:** AI writing may introduce an option that no reader would consider, reject it in a clause, and never mention it again. This often leaves an old drafting idea in the final text. Remove the fake option and state the real constraint directly.
**Before:**
> Session tokens are rotated every 24 hours. A tempting approach would be to rotate them by restarting the auth service on a cron job, but that would drop every active session. Rotation happens in place, and clients refresh transparently.
**After:**
> Session tokens are rotated every 24 hours, in place, and clients refresh transparently.

One rejected option may be valid. Several short, unrelated rejections are a stronger sign. Ask what new information each sentence adds. If it only records an earlier edit, rewrite the paragraph around its main point.
